# Workday Scheduler

## DESCRIPTION
Using JavaScript, and third party APIs, this scheduler lets you add a task to a block of time and save it to remain in the schedule when the page re-opens. Based on the time of day, your tasks will be highlighted to reflect if the time has passed, if it is the current time, or if the tasks will be in the future. I utilized the following techniques in creating this project:

* Pseudocoding logic to see what needs to happen in each file
* Usage of third party APIs including:
    * Bootstrap for the grid layout and basic styling
    * jQuery to grab DOM elements by class and id and apply methods and functions
    * Moment.js to grab current date for the header and display colors based on time
